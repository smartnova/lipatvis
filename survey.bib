	Year = {2014},
	Abstract = {Large dynamic networks are targets of analysis in many fields. Tracking temporal changes at scale in these networks is challenging due in part to the fact that small changes can be missed or drowned-out by the rest of the network. For static networks, current approaches allow the identification of specific network elements within their context. However, in the case of dynamic networks, the user is left alone with finding salient local network elements and tracking them over time. In this work, we introduce a modular DoI specification to flexibly define what salient changes are and to assign them a measure of their importance in a time-varying setting. The specification takes into account neighborhood structure information, numerical attributes of nodes/edges, and their temporal evolution. A tailored visualization of the DoI specification complements our approach. Alongside a traditional node-link view of the dynamic network, it serves as an interface for the interactive definition of a DoI function. By using it to successively refine and investigate the captured details, it supports the analysis of dynamic networks from an initial view until pinpointing a user's analysis goal. We report on applying our approach to scientific coauthorship networks and give concrete results for the DBLP data set.},

	Abstract = {Computing and visualizing sets of elements and their relationships is one of the most common tasks one performs when analyzing and organizing large amounts of data. Common representations of sets such as convex or concave geometries can become cluttered and difficult to parse when these sets overlap in multiple or complex ways, e.g., when multiple elements belong to multiple sets. In this paper, we present a design study of a novel set visual representation, LineSets, consisting of a curve connecting all of the set's elements. Our approach to design the visualization differs from traditional methodology used by the InfoVis community. We first explored the potential of the visualization concept by running a controlled experiment comparing our design sketches to results from the state-of-the-art technique. Our results demonstrated that LineSets are advantageous for certain tasks when compared to concave shapes. We discuss an implementation of LineSets based on simple heuristics and present a study demonstrating that our generated curves do as well as human-drawn ones. Finally, we present two applications of our technique in the context of search tasks on a map and community analysis tasks in social networks.},

	Volume = {19},
	Year = {2013},
	Abstract = {In many applications, data tables contain multi-valued attributes that often store the memberships of the table entities to multiple sets such as which languages a person masters, which skills an applicant documents, or which features a product comes with. With a growing number of entities, the resulting element-set membership matrix becomes very rich of information about how these sets overlap. Many analysis tasks targeted at set-typed data are concerned with these overlaps as salient features of such data. This paper presents Radial Sets, a novel visual technique to analyze set memberships for a large number of elements. Our technique uses frequency-based representations to enable quickly finding and analyzing different kinds of overlaps between the sets, and relating these overlaps to other attributes of the table entities. Furthermore, it enables various interactions to select elements of interest, find out if they are over-represented in specific sets or overlaps, and if they exhibit a different distribution for a specific attribute compared to the rest of the elements. These interactions allow formulating highly-expressive visual queries on the elements in terms of their set memberships and attribute values. As we demonstrate via two usage scenarios, Radial Sets enable revealing and analyzing a multitude of overlapping patterns between large sets, beyond the limits of state-of-the-art techniques.},

Visual overviews that show temporal patterns of paper publication and citation links among papers can help researchers and analysts to see the rate of growth of topics, identify key papers, and understand influences across subdisciplines. This article applies a novel network-visualization tool based on meaningful layouts of nodes to present research fronts and show citation links that indicate influences across research fronts. To demonstrate the value of two-dimensional layouts with multiple regions and user control of link visibility, we conducted a design-oriented, preliminary case study with 6 domain experts over a 4-month period. The main benefits were being able (a) to easily identify key papers and see the increasing number of papers within a research front, and (b) to quickly see the strength and direction of influence across related research fronts.},

To better understand the tasks related to the exploration of dynamic networks, we first introduce a task taxonomy, that informs the design of GraphDiaries, presented afterwards. We then report on a user study, based on representative tasks identified through the taxonomy, and that compares GraphDiaries to existing techniques for temporal navigation in dynamic networks, showing that it outperforms them in terms of both task time and errors for several of these tasks.},

	Abstract = {Bibliographic data such as collections of scientific articles and citation networks have been studied extensively in information visualization and visual analytics research. Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links. Agreement to the selector is represented by word-sized sparkline visualizations seamlessly integrated into the user interface. Based on an analysis of the analytical reasoning process, we derived requirements for the system. We developed the system in a formative way involving other researchers writing literature surveys. A questionnaire study with 14 visual analytics experts confirms that SurVis meets the initially formulated requirements.},

The goal for our research was to develop and test the effectiveness of a web-based application, PaperCube, that was designed to augment a scholar\'s interaction with a digital library and explore bibliographic meta data using a defined set of visualizations. These visualizations needed to provide different levels of visibility into a paper\'s citation network without losing focus of the currently viewed paper. PaperCube was validated through a user study which showed that it was very useful when it comes to augmenting digital library search by reducing the cognitive load put on a scholar and aiding the discoverability of new research material.},

	Abstract = {Never before in history has mankind produced and had access to so much data, information, knowledge, and expertise as today. To organize, access, and manage these valuable assets effectively, we use taxonomies, classification hierarchies, ontologies, controlled vocabularies, and other approaches. We create directory structures for our files. We use organizational hierarchies to structure our work environment. However, the design and continuous update of these organizational schemas with potentially thousands of class nodes organizing millions of entities is challenging for any human being. The taxonomy visualization and validation (TV) tool introduced in this paper supports the semi-automatic validation and optimization of organizational schemas such as file directories, classification hierarchies, taxonomies, or other structures imposed on a data set for organization, access, and naming. By showing the ``goodness of fit'' for a schema and the potentially millions of entities it organizes, the TV tool eases the identification and reclassification of misclassified information entities, the identification of classes that grow too large, the evaluation of the size and homogeneity of existing classes, the examination of the ``well-formedness'' of an organizational schema, and more. As a demonstration, the TV tool is applied to display and examine the United States Patent and Trademark Office patent classification, which organizes more than three million patents into about 160,000 distinct patent classes. The paper concludes with a discussion and an outlook to future work.},

Salient semantic structures and citation patterns are extracted from several collections of documents, including the ACM SIGCHI Conference Proceedings (1995--1997) and ACM Hypertext Conference Proceedings (1987--1998), using Latent Semantic Indexing and Pathfinder Network Scaling. The unique spatial metaphor leads to a natural combination of search and navigation within the same semantic space in a 3-dimensional virtual world. Author co-citation patterns are visualised through a number of author co-citation maps in attempts to reveal the structure of the hypertext, including an overall co-citation map of 367 authors and three periodical maps. These maps highlight predominant research areas in the field. This approach provides a means for transcending the boundaries of collections of documents and visualising more profound patterns in terms of semantic structures and co-citation networks},

	Abstract = {Network evolution is an ubiquitous phenomenon in a wide variety of complex systems. There is an increasing interest in statistically modeling the evolution of complex networks such as small-world networks and scale-free networks. In this article, we address a practical issue concerning the visualizations of co-citation networks of scientific publications derived by two widely known link reduction algorithms, namely minimum spanning trees (MSTs) and pathfinder networks (PFNETs). Our primary goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods in fulfilling the need for visualizing evolving networks. Two criteria are derived for assessing visualizations of evolving networks in terms of topological properties and dynamical properties. We examine the animated visualization models of the evolution of botulinum toxin research in terms of its co-citation structure across a 58-year span (1945-2002). The results suggest that although high-degree nodes dominate the structure of MST models, such structures can be inadequate in depicting the essence of how the network evolves because MST removes potentially significant links from high-order shortest paths. In contrast, PFNET models clearly demonstrate their superiority in maintaining the cohesiveness of some of the most pivotal paths, which in turn make the growth animation more predictable and interpretable. We suggest that the design of visualization and modeling tools for network evolution should take the cohesiveness of critical paths into account.},

The method first derives a sequence of cocitation networks from a series of equal-length time interval slices. These time-registered networks are merged and visualized in a panoramic view in such a way that intellectually significant articles can be identified based on their visually salient features. The method is applied to a cocitation study of the superstring field in theoretical physics. The study focuses on the search of articles that triggered two superstring revolutions. Visually salient nodes in the panoramic view are identified, and the nature of their intellectual contributions is validated by leading scientists in the field. The analysis has demonstrated that a search for intellectual turning points can be narrowed down to visually salient nodes in the visualized network. The method provides a promising way to simplify otherwise cognitively demanding tasks to a search for landmarks, pivots, and hubs.},

	Abstract = {This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature---an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981--2004) and terrorism (1990--2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified.},

	Abstract = {Identifying the significance of specific concepts in the diffusion of scientific knowledge is a challenging issue concerning many theoretical and practical areas. We introduce an innovative visual analytic approach to integrate microscopic and macroscopic perspectives of a rapidly growing scientific knowledge domain. Specifically, our approach focuses on statistically unexpected phrases extracted from unstructured text of titles and abstracts at the microscopic level in association with the magnitude and timeliness of their citation impact at the macroscopic level. The H-index, originally defined to measure individual scientists. productivity in terms of their citation profiles, is extended in two ways: 1) to papers and terms as a means of dividing these items into two groups so as to replace the less optimal threshold-based divisions, and 2) to take into account the timeliness of the impact of knowledge diffusion in terms of the timing of citations and publications so that attention is particularly drawn towards potentially significant and timely papers. The selected terms are connected to higher-level performance indicators, such as measures derived from the H-index, in the form of decision trees. A top-down traversal of such decision trees provides an intuitive walkthrough of concepts and phrases that may underline potentially significant but currently still latent scientific discoveries. Timeliness measures can also help to identify institutions that are at the forefront of a research field. We illustrate how widely accessible tools such as Google Earth can be utilized to disseminate such insights. The practical significance for digital libraries and fostering scientific discoveries is demonstrated through the astronomical literature related to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).},

To connect inter-year communities, the relatively weak communities are eliminated, and then the temporal relations among them are created in terms of the overlapped percentages from communities of previous year to those of the current year. Parts of relations with insignificant linkage strength are removed, leaving several community evolving trajectories for further analysis. The timeline plot clearly shows how communities of smart grid propagated and interrelated over time and could be used to explore the technological changes from the perspective of survival, birth, death, branching, or merging.}}

	Abstract = {Topic modeling has been widely used for analyzing text document collections. Recently, there have been significant advancements in various topic modeling techniques, particularly in the form of probabilistic graphical modeling. State-of-the-art techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been successfully applied in visual text analytics. However, most of the widely-used methods based on probabilistic modeling have drawbacks in terms of consistency from multiple runs and empirical convergence. Furthermore, due to the complicatedness in the formulation and the algorithm, LDA cannot easily incorporate various types of user feedback. To tackle this problem, we propose a reliable and flexible visual analytics system for topic modeling called UTOPIAN (User-driven Topic modeling based on Interactive Nonnegative Matrix Factorization). Centered around its semi-supervised formulation, UTOPIAN enables users to interact with the topic modeling method and steer the result in a user-driven manner. We demonstrate the capability of UTOPIAN via several usage scenarios with real-world document corpuses such as InfoVis/VAST paper data set and product review data sets.},

	Abstract = {Statistical topic models can help analysts discover patterns in large text corpora by identifying recurring sets of words and enabling exploration by topical concepts. However, understanding and validating the output of these models can itself be a challenging analysis task. In this paper, we offer two design considerations - interpretation and trust - for designing visualizations based on data-driven models. Interpretation refers to the facility with which an analyst makes inferences about the data through the lens of a model abstraction. Trust refers to the actual and perceived accuracy of an analyst's inferences. These considerations derive from our experiences developing the Stanford Dissertation Browser, a tool for exploring over 9,000 Ph.D. theses by topical similarity, and a subsequent review of existing literature. We contribute a novel similarity measure for text collections based on a notion of "word-borrowing" that arose from an iterative design process. Based on our experiences and a literature review, we distill a set of design recommendations and describe how they promote interpretable and trustworthy visual analysis tools.},

We introduce Bubble Sets as a visualization technique for data that has both a primary data relation with a semantically significant spatial organization and a significant set membership relation in which members of the same set are not necessarily adjacent in the primary layout. In order to maintain the spatial rights of the primary data relation, we avoid layout adjustment techniques that improve set cluster continuity and density. Instead, we use a continuous, possibly concave, isocontour to delineate set membership, without disrupting the primary layout. Optimizations minimize cluster overlap and provide for calculation of the isocontours at interactive speeds. Case studies show how this technique can be used to indicate multiple sets on a variety of common visualizations.},

	Abstract = {We present PivotPaths, an interactive visualization for exploring faceted information resources. During both work and leisure, we increasingly interact with information spaces that contain multiple facets and relations, such as authors, keywords, and citations of academic publications, or actors and genres of movies. To navigate these interlinked resources today, one typically selects items from facet lists resulting in abrupt changes from one subset of data to another. While filtering is useful to retrieve results matching specific criteria, it can be difficult to see how facets and items relate and to comprehend the effect of filter operations. In contrast, the PivotPaths interface exposes faceted relations as visual paths in arrangements that invite the viewer to `take a stroll' through an information space. PivotPaths supports pivot operations as lightweight interaction techniques that trigger gradual transitions between views. We designed the interface to allow for casual traversal of large collections in an aesthetically pleasing manner that encourages exploration and serendipitous discoveries. This paper shares the findings from our iterative design-and-evaluation process that included semi-structured interviews and a two-week deployment of PivotPaths applied to a large database of academic publications.},

	Year = {2011},
	Abstract = {Scalable and effective analysis of large text corpora remains a challenging problem as our ability to collect textual data continues to increase at an exponential rate. To help users make sense of large text corpora, we present a novel visual analytics system, Parallel-Topics, which integrates a state-of-the-art probabilistic topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with interactive visualization. To describe a corpus of documents, ParallelTopics first extracts a set of semantically meaningful topics using LDA. Unlike most traditional clustering techniques in which a document is assigned to a specific cluster, the LDA model accounts for different topical aspects of each individual document. This permits effective full text analysis of larger documents that may contain multiple topics. To highlight this property of the model, ParallelTopics utilizes the parallel coordinate metaphor to present the probabilistic distribution of a document across topics. Such representation allows the users to discover single-topic vs. multi-topic documents and the relative importance of each topic to a document of interest. In addition, since most text corpora are inherently temporal, ParallelTopics also depicts the topic evolution over time. We have applied ParallelTopics to exploring and analyzing several text corpora, including the scientific proposals awarded by the National Science Foundation and the publications in the VAST community over the years. To demonstrate the efficacy of ParallelTopics, we conducted several expert evaluations, the results of which are reported in this paper.},

	Abstract = {Analyzing large textual collections has become increasingly challenging given the size of the data available and the rate that more data is being generated. Topic-based text summarization methods coupled with interactive visualizations have presented promising approaches to address the challenge of analyzing large text corpora. As the text corpora and vocabulary grow larger, more topics need to be generated in order to capture the meaningful latent themes and nuances in the corpora. However, it is difficult for most of current topic-based visualizations to represent large number of topics without being cluttered or illegible. To facilitate the representation and navigation of a large number of topics, we propose a visual analytics system - HierarchicalTopic (HT). HT integrates a computational algorithm, Topic Rose Tree, with an interactive visual interface. The Topic Rose Tree constructs a topic hierarchy based on a list of topics. The interactive visual interface is designed to present the topic content as well as temporal evolution of topics in a hierarchical fashion. User interactions are provided for users to make changes to the topic hierarchy based on their mental model of the topic space. To qualitatively evaluate HT, we present a case study that showcases how HierarchicalTopics aid expert users in making sense of a large number of topics and discovering interesting patterns of topic groups. We have also conducted a user study to quantitatively evaluate the effect of hierarchical topic structure. The study results reveal that the HT leads to faster identification of large number of relevant topics. We have also solicited user feedback during the experiments and incorporated some suggestions into the current version of HierarchicalTopics.},

We developed an understanding of the value of reference management, statistics, citation text extraction, natural language summarization for single and multiple documents, filters to interactively select key papers, and network visualization to see citation patterns and identify clusters. A three-phase usability study guided our revisions to ASE and led us to improve the testing methods.},

The system is based on a taxonomy of citation database usage for researchers, and provides a timeline visualization for overviews and an influence visualization for detailed views. The timeline displays the general chronology and importance of authors and articles in a citation database, whereas the influence visualization is implemented using the Growing Polygons technique, suitably modified to the context of browsing citation data. Using the latter technique, hierarchies of articles with potentially very long citation chains can be graphically represented. The visualization is augmented with mechanisms for parent-child visualization and suitable interaction techniques for interacting with the view hierarchy and the individual articles in the dataset. We also provide an interactive concept map for keywords and co-authorship using a basic force-directed graph layout scheme. A formal user study indicates that CiteWiz is significantly more efficient than traditional database interfaces for high-level analysis tasks relating to influence and overviews, and equally efficient for low-level tasks such as finding a paper and correlating bibliographical data.},

	Abstract = {The increasingly large number of available writings describing technical and scientific progress, calls for advanced analytic tools for their efficient analysis. This is true for many application scenarios in science and industry and for different types of writings, comprising patents and scientific articles. Despite important differences between patents and scientific articles, both have a variety of common characteristics that lead to similar search and analysis tasks. However, the analysis and visualization of these documents is not a trivial task due to the complexity of the documents as well as the large number of possible relations between their multivariate attributes. In this survey, we review interactive analysis and visualization approaches of patents and scientific articles, ranging from exploration tools to sophisticated mining methods. In a bottom-up approach, we categorize them according to two aspects: (a) data type (text, citations, authors, metadata, and combinations thereof), and (b) task (finding and comparing single entities, seeking elementary relations, finding complex patterns, and in particular temporal patterns, and investigating connections between multiple behaviours). Finally, we identify challenges and research directions in this area that ask for future investigations.},

Specifically, we use the titles of papers from the DBLP database to create what we call maps of computer science (MoCS). Words and phrases from the paper titles are the cities in the map, and countries are created based on word and phrase similarity, calculated using co-occurence. With the help of heatmaps, we can visualize the profile of a particular conference or journal over the base map. Similarly, heatmap profiles can be made of individual researchers or groups such as a department. The visualization system also makes it possible to change the data used to generate the base map. For example, a specific journal or conference can be used to generate the base map and then the heatmap overlays can be used to show the evolution of research topics in the field over the years. As before, individual researchers or research group profiles can be visualized using heatmap overlays over a specific journal or conference base map. We outline a modular and extensible system for term extraction using natural language processing techniques, and show the applicability of methods of information retrieval to calculation of term similarity and creation of a topic map. The system is available at mocs.cs.arizona.edu.},

These bibliographic collections, saved as ASCII files, are processed by HistCite in order to generate chronological and other tables as well as historiographs which highlight the most-cited works in and outside the collection. HistCite also includes a module for detecting and editing errors or variations in cited references as well as a vocabulary analyzer which generates both ranked word lists and word pairs used in the collection. Ideally the system will be used to help the searcher quickly identify the most significant work on a topic and trace its year-by-year historical development. In addition to the collections mentioned above, historiographs based on collections of papers that cite the Watson-Crick 1953 classic paper identifying the helical structure of DNA were created. Both year-by-year as well as month-by-month displays of papers from 1953 to 1958 were necessary to highlight the publication activity of those years.},

Our particular focus is on the process of integrating automated analyses with interactive visualizations in a smooth and fluid manner.

Search queries on PubMed often return thousands of publications and it can be a tedious task to filter out irrelevant publications and choose a manageable set to read. We have developed a visual analytics system, named Bio-Jigsaw, which acts like a visual index on a document collection and supports biologists in investigating and understanding connections between biological entities. We apply natural language processing techniques to identify biological entities such as genes and pathways and visualize connections among them via multiple representations. Connections are based on co-occurrence in abstracts and also are drawn from ontologies or annotations in digital libraries. We demonstrate how Bio-Jigsaw can be used to analyze a PubMed search query on a gene related to breast cancer resulting in over 1500 primary papers.}}

A range of visualization types and control mechanisms to support knowledge discovery are presented. These include corpus- and document-specific views, iterative topic modeling, search, and visual filtering. Drill-down functionality is provided to allow analysts to visualize individual document sections and their relations within the global topic space. Analysts can search across a dataset through a set of expansion techniques on selected document and topic nodes. Furthermore, analysts can select relevant subsets of documents and perform real-time topic modeling on these subsets to interactively visualize topics at various levels of granularity, allowing for a better understanding of the documents. A discussion of the design and implementation choices for each visual analysis technique is presented. This is followed by a discussion of three diverse use cases in which TopicNets enables fast discovery of information that is otherwise hard to find. These include a corpus of 50,000 successful NSF grant proposals, 10,000 publications from a large research center, and single documents including a grant proposal and a PhD thesis.},

By representing both the hierarchical and connectivity structure of the brain, the tool augments the original information space through basic inference and facilitates structured exploration of publications on brain connectivity. We finally report use cases and open challenges in this domain as derived from user feedback. We found anecdotal support that neuroscientists using a multi-scale visual analysis tool can find useful connection information more quickly or discover more information than by using traditional searches like PubMed queries.}}

The focus on temporal thematic change within a context framework allows a user to discern patterns that suggest relationships or trends. For example, the sudden change of thematic strength following an external event may indicate a causal relationship. Such patterns are not readily accessible in other visualizations of the data. We use a river metaphor to convey several key notions. The document collection's time-line, selected thematic content and thematic strength are indicated by the river's directed flow, composition and changing width, respectively. The directed flow from left to right is interpreted as movement through time and the horizontal distance between two points on the river defines a time interval. At any point in time, the vertical distance, or width, of the river indicates the collective strength of the selected themes. Colored "currents" flowing within the river represent individual themes. A current's vertical width narrows or broadens to indicate decreases or increases in the strength of the individual theme},

Despite advances in algorithms and visualization techniques for understanding such social networks, the process of constructing network models and performing exploratory analysis remains difficult and time-consuming. In this article, we present Orion, a system for interactive modeling, transformation, and visualization of network data. Orion's interface enables the rapid manipulation of large graphs---including the specification of complex linking relationships---using simple drag-and-drop operations with desired node types. Orion maps these user interactions to statements in a declarative workflow language that incorporates both relational operators (e.g. selection, aggregation, and joins) and network analytics (e.g. centrality measures). We demonstrate how these features enable analysts to flexibly construct and compare networks in domains such as online health communities, electronic medical records, academic collaboration, and distributed software development},

Past interest in such document sets has spurred the development of numerous visualization approaches for their interactive analysis. They either focus on the textual content of publications, or on document metadata including authors and citations. Previously presented approaches for citation analysis aim primarily at the visualization of the structure of citation networks and their exploration. We extend the state-of-the-art by presenting an approach for the interactive visual analysis of the contents of scientific documents, and combine it with a new and flexible technique to analyze their citations. This technique facilitates user-steered aggregation of citations which are linked to the content of the citing publications using a highly interactive visualization approach. Through enriching the approach with additional interactive views of other important aspects of the data, we support the exploration of the dataset over time and enable users to analyze citation patterns, spot trends, and track long-term developments. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach through a use case and discuss it based on expert user feedback.},

This article describes many global and local patterns we discovered in this data set, together with the exploration process that produced them. Some expected patterns emerged, such as that--like most social networks--coauthorship and citation networks exhibit a power-law degree distribution, with a few widely collaborating authors and highly cited articles. Also, the prestigious and long-established CHI conference has the highest impact (citations by the others). Unexpected insights included that the years when a given conference was most selective are not correlated with those that produced its most highly referenced articles and that influential authors have distinct patterns of collaboration. An interesting sidelight is that methods from the HCI field--exploratory data analysis by information visualization and direct-manipulation interaction--proved useful for this analysis. They allowed us to take an open-ended, exploratory approach, guided by the data itself. As we answered our original questions, new ones arose; as we confirmed patterns we expected, we discovered refinements, exceptions, and fascinating new ones.},

	Volume = {13},
	Year = {2007},
	Abstract = {The need to visualize large social networks is growing as hardware capabilities make analyzing large networks feasible and many new data sets become available. Unfortunately, the visualizations in existing systems do not satisfactorily resolve the basic dilemma of being readable both for the global structure of the network and also for detailed analysis of local communities. To address this problem, we present NodeTrix, a hybrid representation for networks that combines the advantages of two traditional representations: node-link diagrams are used to show the global structure of a network, while arbitrary portions of the network can be shown as adjacency matrices to better support the analysis of communities. A key contribution is a set of interaction techniques. These allow analysts to create a NodeTrix visualization by dragging selections to and from node-link and matrix forms, and to flexibly manipulate the NodeTrix representation to explore the dataset and create meaningful summary visualizations of their findings. Finally, we present a case study applying NodeTrix to the analysis of the InfoVis 2004 coauthorship dataset to illustrate the capabilities of NodeTrix as both an exploration tool and an effective means of communicating results.},

The map has been computed using the hierarchical self-organizing map, and a specific graphical design supports the visualization and use of the map interface. In the design, there are specific iconic representations for the projects, publications and persons displayed on the map. The novel aspects in this WEBSOM-type of document map are that the texts on the map are written in different languages, and there are different types of textual objects mapped on the same map. The interlingual mapping is based on applying machine translation on non-English documents. Even when the translation is not fully correct, the approach works well when large enough proportion of relevant terminology has become translated.},

To help users to understand the academic collaboration and knowledge domain of individuals, we developed an InterRing visualizer which shows not only the weight of co-authorship of an individual with other researchers in particular academic year, but also the knowledge domain of the individual that was covered by his/her publications published in a past period},

A hierarchical topic model is adopted to extract topics of three different domains and to correlate the extracted topics. A simple yet effective visualization interface is then designed, and certain interaction operations are provided to help users more deeply understand the visualization development trend and the correlation among the three domains.

	Abstract = {The visualization of networks with additional attributes attached to the network elements is one of the ongoing challenges in the information visualization domain. Such so-called multivariate networks regularly appear in various application fields, for instance, in data sets which describe friendship networks or co-authorship networks. Here, we focus on networks that are based on text documents, i.e., the network nodes represent documents and the edges show relationships between them. Those relationships can be derived from common topics or common co-authors. Attached attributes may be specific keywords (topics), keyword frequencies, etc. The analysis of such multivariate networks is challenging, because a deeper understanding of the data provided depends on effective visualization and interaction techniques that are able to bring all types of information together. In addition, automatic analysis methods should be used to support the analysis process of potentially large amounts of data. In this paper, we present a visualization approach that tackles those analysis problems. Our implementation provides a combination of new techniques that shows intra-cluster and inter-cluster relations while giving insight into the content of the cluster attributes. Hence, it facilitates the interactive exploration of the networks under consideration by showing the relationships between node clusters in context of network topology and multivariate attributes.},

This paper offers an abstract Content-Actor network data model, a classification of tasks, and a tool to support them. The NetLens interface was designed around the abstract Content-Actor network data model to allow users to pose a series of elementary queries and iteratively refine visual overviews and sorted lists. This enables the support of complex queries that are traditionally hard to specify. NetLens is general and scalable in that it applies to any data set that can be represented with our abstract data model. This paper describes the use of NetLens with a subset of the ACM Digital Library consisting of about 4000 papers from the CHI conference written by about 6000 authors, and reports on a usability study with nine participants.},

	Abstract = {Patents are of growing importance in current economic markets. Analyzing patent information has, therefore, become a common task for many interest groups. As a prerequisite for patent analysis, extensive search for relevant patent information is essential. Unfortunately, the complexity of patent material inhibits a straightforward retrieval of all relevant patent documents and leads to iterative, time-consuming approaches in practice. Already the amount of patent data to be analyzed poses challenges with respect to scalability. Further scalability issues arise concerning the diversity of users and the large variety of analysis tasks. With "PatViz'', a system for interactive analysis of patent information has been developed addressing scalability at various levels. PatViz provides a visual environment allowing for interactive reintegration of insights into subsequent search iterations, thereby bridging the gap between search and analytic processes. Because of its extensibility, we expect that the approach we have taken can be employed in different problem domains that require high quality of search results regarding their completeness.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a visualization system for getting insight into future research activities from co-authorship networks. A bibliographic network such as a co-authorship network and a citation network is important information for researchers when doing a research survey. In particular, there are many requests on research survey that relate with researchers' future activities, such as identification of remarkable of researchers including growing researchers and supervisors. Although a citation network has received many attentions from researchers, it is not suitable for such surveys because it reflects researchers' past activities. Since collaboration of researchers is essential for researchers' activities, co-authorship network is suitable for predicting future activities. In order to get insights into future research activities by discriminating growing research areas from grown-up areas, the proposed visualization system provides the function for identifying research areas and that for identifying time variation of both network structure and keyword distribution. As a basis for getting insights into future research activities, this paper focuses on the task of discriminating growing researchers from supervisors. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated through the detailed analysis of two participants' analyzing process of InfoVis 2004 Contest dataset.},

PaperLens was developed to visualize 8 years (1995-2002) of InfoVis conference proceedings and was then extended to visualize 23 years (1982-2004) of the CHI conference proceedings. This paper describes how we analyzed the data and designed PaperLens. We also describe a user study to focus our redesign efforts along with the design changes we made to address usability issues. We summarize lessons learned in the process of design and scaling up to the larger set of CHI conference papers.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has shown that faceted browsing is effective and enjoyable in searching and browsing large collections of data. In this work, we explore the efficacy of interactive visualization systems in supporting exploration and sensemaking within faceted datasets. To do this, we developed an interactive visualization system called FacetLens, which exposes trends and relationships within faceted datasets. FacetLens implements linear facets to enable users not only to identify trends but also to easily compare several trends simultaneously. Furthermore, it offers pivot operations to allow users to navigate the faceted dataset using relationships between items. We evaluate the utility of the system through a description of insights gained while experts used the system to explore the CHI publication repository as well as a database of funding grant data, and report a formative user study that identified usability issues.},

	Title = {{iVisClustering: An Interactive Visual Document Clustering via Topic Modeling}},
	Year = {2012},
	Abstract = {Clustering plays an important role in many large-scale data analyses providing users with an overall understanding of their data. Nonetheless, clustering is not an easy task due to noisy features and outliers existing in the data, and thus the clustering results obtained from automatic algorithms often do not make clear sense. To remedy this problem, automatic clustering should be complemented with interactive visualization strategies. This paper proposes an interactive visual analytics system for document clustering, called iVisClustering, based on a widely-used topic modeling method, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). iVisClustering provides a summary of each cluster in terms of its most representative keywords and visualizes soft clustering results in parallel coordinates. The main view of the system provides a 2D plot that visualizes cluster similarities and the relation among data items with a graph-based representation. iVisClustering provides several other views, which contain useful interaction methods. With help of these visualization modules, we can interactively refine the clustering results in various ways. Keywords can be adjusted so that they characterize each cluster better. In addition, our system can filter out noisy data and re-cluster the data accordingly. Cluster hierarchy can be constructed using a tree structure and for this purpose, the system supports cluster-level interactions such as sub-clustering, removing unimportant clusters, merging the clusters that have similar meanings, and moving certain clusters to any other node in the tree structure. Furthermore, the system provides document-level interactions such as moving mis-clustered documents to another cluster and removing useless documents. Finally, we present how interactive clustering is performed via iVisClustering by using real-world document data sets.},

The main objective is understanding of the knowledge transfer processes between technical fields, institutions and countries. This includes identifying key influential players and subfields, the knowledge transfer patterns among them, and the overall knowledge transfer efficiency. The proposed framework is applied to the field of nanoscale science and engineering (NSE), including the citation networks of patent documents, submitting institutions, technology fields, and countries. The NSE patents were identified by keywords full-text searching of patents at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The analysis shows that the United States is the most important citation center in NSE research. The institution citation network illustrates a more efficient knowledge transfer between institutions than a random network. The country citation network displays a knowledge transfer capability as efficient as a random network. The technology field citation network and the patent document citation network exhibit a less efficient knowledge diffusion capability than a random network. All four citation networks show a tendency to form local citation clusters.},

In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a prototype visualization system to enhance author searching. The system, called AuthorLink, is based on author co-citation analysis and visualization mapping algorithms such as Kohonen's feature maps and Pathfinder networks. AuthorLink produces interactive author maps in real time from a database of 1.26 million records supplied by the Institute for Scientific Information. The maps show subject groupings and more fine-grained intellectual connections among authors. Through the interactive interface the user can take advantage of such information to refine queries and retrieve documents through point-and-click manipulation of the authors names.},

Network information often involves slow access that conflicts with the use of highly-interactive information visualization. Butterfly addresses this problem, integrating search, browsing, and access management via four techniques: 1) visualization supports the assimilation of retrieved information and integrates search and browsing activity, 2) automatically-created link-generating queries assemble bibliographic records that contain reference information into citation graphs, 3) asynchronous query processes explore the resulting graphs for the user, and 4) process controllers allow the user to manage these processes. We use our positive experience with the Butterfly implementation to propose a general information access approach, called Organic User Interfaces for Information Access, in which a virtual landscape grows under user control as information is accessed automatically.},

Due to the steady increase in the number of scientific publications, it is hard to keep an overview of the structure and dynamic development of one's own field of science, much less all scientific domains. However, knowledge of ``hot'' topics, emergent research frontiers, or change of focus in certain areas is a critical component of resource allocation decisions in research laboratories, governmental institutions, and corporations. This paper demonstrates the utilization of Kleinberg's burst detection algorithm, co-word occurrence analysis, and graph layout techniques to generate maps that support the identification of major research topics and trends. The approach was applied to analyze and map the complete set of papers published in PNAS in the years 1982-2001. Six domain experts examined and commented on the resulting maps in an attempt to reconstruct the evolution of major research areas covered by PNAS.},

	Abstract = {ActiveGraph is an information visualization tool designed to provide users with a concise, customizable view of objects in a digital library. A set of digital library objects is represented as a data set in a two- or three-dimensional scatter plot. The data set can represent any digital library objects in any medium: books, journals, papers, images, Web resources, or even entire databases. Since ActiveGraph is intended for use in the context of digital libraries, data attributes consist for the most part of metadata fields such as title, author, date of publication, and number of citations. Data attributes are mapped to six visual attributes of the scatter plot: the X-, Y-, and Z-axes, color, size, and shape. The metadata for a selected data point are displayed in a control panel on the right-hand side of the screen. Users can edit the metadata and even add new metadata fields. Thus ActiveGraph allows users to both view and customize the contents of a library. Because of its flexibility in handling digital library objects and metadata of different types, ActiveGraph can be used in a variety of digital library applications. In this paper, we describe two: LibGraph, which is a visualization of a collaborative library, and CiteGraph, which is a visualization of citation statistics. Both applications were designed for use by scientists and engineers, for whom scatter plots are familiar and intuitive visualizations.},

In this paper, we examine the functionality needed to visualize bibliographies effectively. After reviewing some existing tools, we present BIVTECI (Bibliographic Visualization Tool with Enhanced Citation Interactivity) which derives from our analysis.Our main research goal is to capture the user-required relationships between bibliographic entries or articles. First, a user must understand the chronology of articles. Second, a userneeds to see the influence of articles on later work, i.e., the citation relationships. Third, the user wishes to group articles by specified attributes (e.g., title, author, keyword). Fourth, the user needs to examine information at varying levels of detail from general, multi-article views to specific, single-article ones. Finally, the user may need to use several information views simultaneously. We note that baseline functionality includes simple retrieval of entries by title, author, and keyword.The prototype BIVTECI tool demonstrates effective solutions for most of these requirements, combining information visualization with manipulation. The article proposes future research into features not yet implemented. BIVTECI is based on the Star data translator and the Landscape information visualizer, both developed at the University of Toronto.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive visualizations aim to reduce the complexity of visual representations and convey information using interactive visualizations. Although the research on adaptive visualizations grew in the last years, the existing approaches do not make use of the variety of adaptable visual variables. Further the existing approaches often premises experts, who has to model the initial visualization design. In addition, current approaches either incorporate user behavior or data types. A combination of both is not proposed to our knowledge. This paper introduces the instantiation of our previously proposed model that combines both: involving different influencing factors for and adapting various levels of visual peculiarities, on visual layout and visual presentation in a multiple visualization environment. Based on data type and users' behavior, our system adapts a set of applicable visualization types. Moreover, retinal variables of each visualization type are adapted to meet individual or canonic requirements on both, data types and users' behavior. Our system does not require an initial expert modeling.},

Certainly this style of metro map has been adopted in many cities to assist train travellers understand the various routes and network connections. This work reports on a preliminary investigation into the question: Can the metro map metaphor be adapted for effectively displaying more abstract knowledge? Four case studies are described that use the metro map metaphor for presenting abstract, interconnecting "trains of thought". These four case studies include using a metro map to summarise the ideas in a complex thesis, using a metro map to communicate a business plan, using a metro map as navigation aid for Web pages and using a metro map to assist university students understand a course structure. This work discusses the aspects of these abstract metro maps from an information visualisation perspective. Experiences learned from the case studies are used to introduce some issues and guidelines for using this metaphor to help people find their way through more abstract data.},

	Abstract = {Visualization of author or document influence networks as a two-dimensional image can provide key insights into the direct influence of authors or documents on each other in a document collection. The influence network is constructed based on the minimum spanning tree, in which the nodes are documents and an edge is the most direct influence between two documents. Influence network visualizations have typically relied on co-citation correlation as a measure of document similarity. That is, the similarity between two documents is computed by correlating the sets of citations to each of the two documents. In a different line of research, co-citation count (the number of times two documents are jointly cited) has been applied as a document similarity measure. In this work, we demonstrate the impact of each of these similarity measures on the document influence network. We provide examples, and analyze the significance of the choice of similarity measure. We show that correlation-based visualizations exhibit chaining effects (low average vertex degree), a manifestation of multiple minor variations in document similarities. These minor similarity variations are absent in count-based visualizations. The result is that count-based influence network visualizations are more consistent with the intuitive expectation of authoritative documents being hubs that directly influence large numbers of documents.},

Furthermore, we suggest a novel visualization method called DiTop-View, in which topics are represented by glyphs (topic coins) that are arranged on a 2D plane. Topic coins are designed to encode all information necessary for performing comparative analyses such as the class membership of a topic, its most probable terms and the discriminative relations. We evaluate our topic analysis using statistical measures and a small user experiment and present an expert case study with researchers from political sciences analyzing two real-world datasets.},

Daily newspapers, books, scientific and governmental publications, blogs and private messages have grown into a wellspring of endless information and knowledge. Since neither existing nor new information can be read in its entirety, we rely increasingly on computers to extract and visualize meaningful or interesting topics and documents from this huge information reservoir. In this paper, we extend, improve and combine existing individual approaches into an overall framework that supports topological analysis of high dimensional document point clouds given by the well-known tf-idf document-term weighting method. We show that traditional distance-based approaches fail in very high dimensional spaces, and we describe an improved two-stage method for topology-based projections from the original high dimensional information space to both two dimensional (2-D) and three dimensional (3-D) visualizations. To demonstrate the accuracy and usability of this framework, we compare it to methods introduced recently and apply it to complex document and patent collections.},

To address this gap we have developed a novel tool, Rexplore, which integrates statistical analysis, semantic technologies, and visual analytics to provide effective support for exploring and making sense of scholarly data. Here, we describe the main innovative elements of the tool and we present the results from a task-centric empirical evaluation, which shows that Rexplore is highly effective at providing support for the aforementioned sensemaking tasks. In addition, these results are robust both with respect to the background of the users (i.e., expert analysts vs. `ordinary' users) and also with respect to whether the tasks are selected by the evaluators or proposed by the users themselves. ,},

We provide a three-level approach for exploring the finding spots in context. The overview shows the relationship of the entire suspicious document to the set of source documents. A glyph-based view reveals the structural and textual differences and similarities of a set of finding spots and their corresponding source text fragments. For further analysis and editing of the finding spot's assessment, the actual text fragments can be embedded side-by-side in the diffline view. The different views are tied together by versatile navigation and selection operations.

The result is a map that both simplifies and highlights the regularities in the structure and their relationships. We illustrate the method by making a map of scientific communication as captured in the citation patterns of 6,000 journals. We discover a multicentric organization with fields that vary dramatically in size and degree of integration into the network of science. Along the backbone of the network including physics, chemistry, molecular biology, and medicine information flows bidirectionally, but the map reveals a directional pattern of citation from the applied fields to the basic sciences.},

Networks and clustering methods have become important tools to comprehend instances of these large-scale structures, but without methods to distinguish between real trends and noisy data, these approaches are not useful for studying how networks change. Only if we can assign significance to the partitioning of single networks can we distinguish meaningful structural changes from random fluctuations. Here we show that bootstrap resampling accompanied by significance clustering provides a solution to this problem. To connect changing structures with the changing function of networks, we highlight and summarize the significant structural changes with alluvial diagrams and realize de Solla Price's vision of mapping change in science: studying the citation pattern between about 7000 scientific journals over the past decade, we find that neuroscience has transformed from an interdisciplinary specialty to a mature and stand-alone discipline.},

	Abstract = {To comprehend the hierarchical organization of large integrated systems, we introduce the hierarchical map equation, which reveals multilevel structures in networks. In this information-theoretic approach, we exploit the duality between compression and pattern detection; by compressing a description of a random walker as a proxy for real flow on a network, we find regularities in the network that induce this system-wide flow. Finding the shortest multilevel description of the random walker therefore gives us the best hierarchical clustering of the network the optimal number of levels and modular partition at each level with respect to the dynamics on the network. With a novel search algorithm, we extract and illustrate the rich multilevel organization of several large social and biological networks. For example, from the global air traffic network we uncover countries and continents, and from the pattern of scientific communication we reveal more than 100 scientific fields organized in four major disciplines: life sciences, physical sciences, ecology and earth sciences, and social sciences. In general, we find shallow hierarchical structures in globally interconnected systems, such as neural networks, and rich multilevel organizations in systems with highly separated regions, such as road networks.},

	Year = {2011},
	Abstract = {There are a growing number of machine learning algorithms which operate on graphs. Example applications for these algorithms include predicting which customers will recommend products to their friends in a viral marketing campaign using a customer network, predicting the topics of publications in a citation network, or predicting the political affiliations of people in a social network. It is important for an analyst to have tools to help compare the output of these machine learning algorithms. In this work, we present G-PARE, a visual analytic tool for comparing two uncertain graphs, where each uncertain graph is produced by a machine learning algorithm which outputs probabilities over node labels. G-PARE provides several different views which allow users to obtain a global overview of the algorithms output, as well as focused views that show subsets of nodes of interest. By providing an adaptive exploration environment, G-PARE guides the users to places in the graph where two algorithms predictions agree and places where they disagree. This enables the user to follow cascades of misclassifications by comparing the algorithms outcome with the ground truth. After describing the features of G-PARE, we illustrate its utility through several use cases based on networks from different domains.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic network visualization has been a challenging research topic due to the visual and computational complexity introduced by the extra time dimension. Existing solutions are usually good for overview and presentation tasks, but not for the interactive analysis of a large dynamic network. We introduce in this paper a new approach which considers only the dynamic network central to a focus node, also known as the egocentric dynamic network. Our major contribution is a novel 1.5D visualization design which greatly reduces the visual complexity of the dynamic network without sacrificing the topological and temporal context central to the focus node. In our design, the egocentric dynamic network is presented in a single static view, supporting rich analysis through user interactions on both time and network. We propose a general framework for the 1.5D visualization approach, including the data processing pipeline, the visualization algorithm design, and customized interaction methods. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on egocentric dynamic network analysis tasks, through case studies and a controlled user experiment comparing with three baseline dynamic network visualization methods.},

	Volume = {PP},
	Year = {2015},
	Abstract = {Visually analyzing citation networks poses challenges to many fields of the data mining research. How can we summarize a large citation graph according to the user's interest? In particular, how can we illustrate the impact of a highly influential paper through the summarization? Can we maintain the sensory node-link graph structure while revealing the flow-based influence patterns and preserving a fine readability? The state-of-the-art influence maximization algorithms can detect the most influential node in a citation network, but fail to summarize a graph structure to account for its influence. On the other hand, existing graph summarization methods fold large graphs into clustered views, but can not reveal the hidden influence patterns underneath the citation network. In this paper, we first formally define the Influence Graph Summarization problem on citation networks. Second, we propose a matrix decomposition based algorithm pipeline to solve the IGS problem. Our method can not only highlight the flow-based influence patterns, but also easily extend to support the rich attribute information. A prototype system called VEGAS implementing this pipeline is also developed. Third, we present a theoretical analysis on our main algorithm, which is equivalent to the kernel k-mean clustering. It can be proved that the matrix decomposition based algorithm can approximate the objective of the proposed IGS problem. Last, we conduct comprehensive experiments with real-world citation networks to compare the proposed algorithm with classical graph summarization methods. Evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the previous ones in optimizing both the quantitative IGS objective and the quality of the visual summarizations.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we performed a comparative study in two research domains in order to develop a method of detecting emerging knowledge domains. The selected domains are research on gallium nitride (GaN) and research on complex networks, which represent recent examples of innovative research. We divided citation networks into clusters using the topological clustering method, tracked the positions of papers in each cluster, and visualized citation networks with characteristic terms for each cluster. Analyzing the clustering results with the average age and parent--children relationship of each cluster may be helpful in detecting emergence. In addition, topological measures, within-cluster degree z and participation coefficient P, succeeded in determining whether there are emerging knowledge clusters. There were at least two types of development of knowledge domains. One is incremental innovation as in GaN and the other is branching innovation as in complex networks. In the domains where incremental innovation occurs, papers changed their position to large z and large P. On the other hand, in the case of branching innovation, they moved to a position with large z and small P, because there is a new emerging cluster, and active research centers shift rapidly. Our results showed that topological measures are beneficial in detecting branching innovation in the citation network of scientific publications.},

	Abstract = {Digital library search results are usually shown as a textual list, with 10-20 items per page. Viewing several thousand search results at once on a two-dimensional display with continuous variables is a promising alternative. Since these displays can overwhelm some users, we created a simplified two-dimensional display that uses categorical and hierarchical axes, called hieraxes. Users appreciate the meaningful and limited number of terms on each hieraxis. At each grid point of the display we show a cluster of color-coded dots or a bar chart. Users see the entire result set and can then click on labels to move down a level in the hierarchy. Handling broad hierarchies and arranging for imposed hierarchies led to additional design innovations. We applied hieraxes to a digital video library of science topics used by middle school teachers, a legal information system, and a technical library using the ACM Computing Classification System. Feedback from usability testing with 32 subjects revealed strengths and weaknesses.},

The key terms are extracted using an advanced text mining approach based on a fully automatic document structure extraction. The images and their captions are extracted using a graphical heuristic and the captions are used for a semi-semantic image weighting. Furthermore, we use the image color histogram for classification and show at least one representative from each non-empty image class. The approach is demonstrated for the IEEE InfoVis publications of a complete year. The method can easily be applied to other publication collections and sets of documents which contain images.}}

The project has investigated the technicalities and practicalities of capturing conceptual relations, within and between conventional documents in terms of abstract ontological structures. In this way, we have developed a new kind of index to distributed digital library systems. This paper reports a case study undertaken to test the sensemaking tools developed by the Scholarly Ontologies project.

	Abstract = {We apply a version of our web-based literature-mapping system to PNAS for 1971-2002, as indexed by the National Library of Medicine and the Institute for Scientific Information. Given a single input term from a user, a medical subject heading, a cocited author, or a cocited journal, PNASLINK rapidly displays views in which that term and the other 24 terms that most frequently co-occur with it in a bibliographic database are interrelated in ways suggesting fruitful combinations for document retrieval. The interrelationships are produced by two algorithms, pathfinder networks and Kohonen-style self-organizing maps. PNASLINK displays are themselves interactive interfaces that can retrieve documents from digital libraries (e.g., PNAS Online). This style of visualizing knowledge domains is called ``localized'' because it does not attempt to map the indexing of literatures in full but concentrates on the top terms in an ``associative thesaurus'' reflecting user interests. It also permits swift remappings, as the user recognizes terms worth pursuing. PNASLINK is illustrated with maps drawn from the literature of population genetics. Some comparative and evaluative comments are added, one from a domain expert indicating that the face validity of the system may be tempered by insufficient specificity in the indexing terms being mapped.},

In this position paper, we propose an approach based on modelling patent repositories as multivariate temporal networks, and examining them by the means of specific visual analytics methods.

	Abstract = {Patent landscaping is a significant activity for modern businesses. Understanding and taking action on information gleaned from analyses of intellectual property (IP) in specific product or technology domains is necessary for many business decisions. Examples include decisions about future product development, about how to guard against litigation threats from competitors, about how to set R&D priorities, about how to value IP for sale or licensing, and about how to target companies for mergers and acquisitions. This paper proposes a novel method for visualizing patent landscapes that supports the complex hierarchical, multi-dimensional, multi-typed data found in this domain. Our solution directly addresses the problem of how to provide high-level overviews of such a complex domain while at the same time providing enough detail to draw attention to the most significant areas of difference for further drill-down leading to actionable intelligence.}}

In this paper, we present INVISQUE - an approach and experimental software for interactive visual search and query. INVISQUE uses an index card metaphor to display library content, organized in a way that visually integrates attributes such citations and date published, making it easy to pick out the most recent and most cited paper.

	Abstract = {Abstract Word clouds are proliferating on the Internet and have received much attention in visual analytics. Although word clouds can help users understand the major content of a document collection quickly, their ability to visually compare documents is limited. This paper introduces a new method to create semantic-preserving word clouds by leveraging tailored seam carving, a well-established content-aware image resizing operator. The method can optimize a word cloud layout by removing a left-to-right or top-to-bottom seam iteratively and gracefully from the layout. Each seam is a connected path of low energy regions determined by a Gaussian-based energy function. With seam carving, we can pack the word cloud compactly and effectively, while preserving its overall semantic structure. Furthermore, we design a set of interactive visualization techniques for the created word clouds to facilitate visual text analysis and comparison. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our techniques.},

	Abstract = {Visualizing the intellectual structure of scientific domains using co-cited units such as references or authors has become a routine for domain analysis. In previous studies, paper-reference matrices are usually transformed into reference-reference matrices to obtain co-citation relationships, which are then visualized in different representations, typically as node-link networks, to represent the intellectual structures of scientific domains. Such network visualizations sometimes contain tightly knit components, which make visual analysis of the intellectual structure a challenging task. In this study, we propose a new approach to reveal co-citation relationships. Instead of using a reference-reference matrix, we directly use the original paper-reference matrix as the information source, and transform the paper-reference matrix into an FP-tree and visualize it in a Java-based prototype system. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through visual analyses of the intellectual structure of two domains: Information Visualization and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The results show that our visualization not only retains the major information of co-citation relationships, but also reveals more detailed sub-structures of tightly knit clusters than a conventional node-link network visualization.},

The exploration of this data is challenging not only because of large data scales but also the complexity of resource structures and semantics. In this paper, we present PivotSlice, an interactive visualization technique which provides efficient faceted browsing as well as flexible capabilities to discover data relationships. With the metaphor of direct manipulation, PivotSlice allows the user to visually and logically construct a series of dynamic queries over the data, based on a multi-focus and multi-scale tabular view that subdivides the entire dataset into several meaningful parts with customized semantics. PivotSlice further facilitates the visual exploration and sensemaking process through features including live search and integration of online data, graphical interaction histories and smoothly animated visual state transitions. We evaluated PivotSlice through a qualitative lab study with university researchers and report the findings from our observations and interviews. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of PivotSlice using a scenario of exploring a repository of information visualization literature.},
